# Bessambly Programming Language
Bessambly is the lowest-level language developed by Sahne Dünya, where not all code is hardware-specific. The Bessambly programming language's usage is similar to Assembly Language, but there's a distinct difference: while all code in Assembly Language must be hardware-specific, not all code written in Bessambly is hardware-specific, unlike modern programming languages, but it's not as high-level as modern programming languages. There's more than one reason for this rather interesting structure. You can understand this by reading the "src/syntax.md" file. Sahne Dünya's development goal for this programming language is to create an interesting product for the software world. The Standard AOT Compiler, the project currently in the repository, only supports the RISC-V 32-bit architecture in its initial releases, but cross-platform support may be added in subsequent releases. The initial release supports two systems: Unix (Unix Standard System Calls) and Baremetal (Direct Hardware). Future releases may offer more support. You can learn how to use it in the compiler from the "manual.md" file.
